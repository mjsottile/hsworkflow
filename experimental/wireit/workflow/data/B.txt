Most handles will also have a current I/O position indicating where the
next input or output operation will occur. A handle is readable if it
manages only input or both input and output; likewise, it is writable if it
manages only output or both input and output. A handle is open when first
allocated. Once it is closed it can no longer be used for either input or
output, though an implementation cannot re-use its storage while references
remain to it. Handles are in the Show and Eq classes. The string produced
by showing a handle is system dependent; it should include enough
information to identify the handle for debugging. A handle is equal
according to == only to itself; no attempt is made to compare the internal
state of different handles for equality.
