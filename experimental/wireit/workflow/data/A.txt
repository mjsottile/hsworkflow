Computation hGetContents hdl returns the list of characters corresponding
to the unread portion of the channel or file managed by hdl, which is put
into an intermediate state, semi-closed. In this state, hdl is effectively
closed, but items are read from hdl on demand and accumulated in a special
list returned by hGetContents hdl.
