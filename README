Workflow representation using lazy functional streams

This repository contains code and PDF documents related to a basic method
for representing workflows in Haskell using lazy functional streams to
capture the abstraction of data flow between activities.  We have included
the current code, and the PDF files for both the paper and presentations
related to the paper.
